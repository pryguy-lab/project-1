                Bella is a special dog that came into our lives six weeks ago and life will never be the same!            
                 Bella is still a puppy, just sixteen weeks old and has very sharp puppy teeth. She was the runt of the litter but you would never guess that by her size.
            </p>

            <p class="bella_p2">
                Bella loves to run in the park while chasing leaves and ocassionally stopping to chew a stick or two. She also loves to swim in the creek at the park or the lake.

                We have fun with Bella and like to call her names like "Bella Bee" and "Goof Ball"
